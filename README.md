# Rate Equations

This is a simple matlab script for solving the laser rate equations. Basically, this just recreates some of the plots from chapter 5 in the Coldren textbook showing laser dynamics at turn-on (i.e. turn-on delay, osciallations, settling time, etc.). And yes, I know this is not the most efficient way to numerically solve the rate equation, but it is the simplest :)

I also wanted to play around with the github pages feature for project sites :)
